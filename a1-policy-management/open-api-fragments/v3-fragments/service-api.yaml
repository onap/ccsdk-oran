    description: A registered service should invoke this operation regularly to
      indicate that it is still alive. If a registered service fails to invoke some operation,
      or this operation, before the end of a timeout period the service will be deregistered
      and all its A1 policies wil be removed and the service is deleted.
      This operation is only intended for registered services. (This timeout can be set or disabled when
      each service is initially registered). Unregistered services do not need to invoke this operation,
      since the optional keep-alive monitoring feature can only be enabled for registered services.

      Service registration is required to get callbacks about available NearRT RICs 
      and to enable supervision of the service's active status. If a registered
      service becomes inactive, its policies can be automatically deleted.
      A1 Policy instances can also be created for unregistered services. 
      If an unregistered service is later registered, the service's policies are 
      retained when the service becomes registered. This feature is optional to use.
