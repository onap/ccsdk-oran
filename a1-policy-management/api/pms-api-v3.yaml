  description: "<h2>General</h2><p>The O-RAN Non-RT RIC Policy Management Service\
        \ provides a REST API for managemecnt of A1 policies. <br/>The main tasks of the\
        \ service are:</p><ul><li>A1 Policy creation, modification and deletion.</li><li>Monitoring\
        \ and maintaining consistency of the SMO view of A1 policies and the Near-RT RICs</li><li>Maintaining\
        \ a view of supported Near-RT RIC policy types</li><li>Supervision of using services\
        \ (R-APPs). When a service is unavailable, its policies are removed.</li></ul><h2>APIs\
        \ provided or defined by the service</h2><h3>A1 Policy Management</h3><p>This\
        \ is an API for management of A1 Policies.</p><ul><li>A1 Policy retrieval, creation,\
        \ modification and deletion.</li><li>Retrieval of supported A1 Policy types for\
        \ a Near-RT RIC</li><li>Retrieval of status for existing A1 policies</li></ul><h3>Management\
        \ of configuration</h3><p>API for updating and retrieval of the component configuration.\
        \ Note that there other ways to maintain the configuration.</p><h3>Service callbacks</h3><p>These\
        \ are endpoints that are invoked by this service. The callbacks are registered\
        \ in this service at service registration.</p><h3>NearRT-RIC Repository</h3><p>This\
        \ is an API that provides support for looking up a NearRT-RIC. Each A1 policy\
        \ is targeted for one Near-RT RIC.</p><h3>Health Check</h3><p>API used for supervision\
        \ of the PMS component.</p><h3>Service Registry and Supervision</h3><p>API used\
        \ for registering services that uses PMS. Each A1 policy is optionally owned by\
        \ a service. PMS can supervise each registered service by a heart-beat supervision\
        \ and will automatically remove policies for unavailable services. Note that a\
        \ service does not need to be registered in order to create A1 Policies. This\
        \ is a feature that is optional to use.</p><h3>Authorization API</h3><p>API used\
        \ for access control of A1 Policy access. If configured, an external authorization\
        \ provider is requested to grant access to the A1 Policy type.</p>"
