  title: A1 Policy management service
  description: <h2>General</h2><p>The O-RAN Non-RT RIC Policy Management Service provides
    a REST API for management of A1 policices. <br/>The main tasks of the service
    are:</p><ul><li>A1 Policy creation, modification and deletion.</li><li>Monitoring
    and maintaining consistency of the SMO view of A1 policies and the Near-RT RICs</li><li>Maintaining
    a view of supported Near-RT RIC policy types</li><li>Supervision of using services
    (R-APPs). When a service is unavailble, its policies are removed.</li></ul><h2>APIs
    provided by the service</h2><h3>A1 Policy Management</h3><p>This is an API for
    management of A1 Policies.</p><ul><li>A1 Policy retrieval, creation, modification
    and deletion.</li><li>Retrieval of supported A1 Policy types for a Near-RT RIC</li><li>Retrieval
    of status for existing A1 policies</li></ul><h3>Management of configuration</h3><p>API
    for updating and retrieval of the component configuration. Note that there other
    ways to maintain the configuration.</p><h3>Callbacks</h3><p>These are endpoints
    that are invoked by this service. The callbacks are registerred in this service
    at service registration.</p><h3>NearRT-RIC Repository</h3><p>This is an API that
    provides support for looking up a NearRT-RIC. Each A1 policy is targeted for one
    Near-RT RIC.</p><h3>Health Check</h3><p>API used for supervision of the PMS component.</p><h3>Service
    Registry and Supervision</h3><p>API used for registerring services that uses PMS.
    Each A1 policy is owned by a service. PMS can supervise each registerred service
    and will automatically remove policies for unavailable services.</p>
